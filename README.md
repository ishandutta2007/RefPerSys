# refpersys


This project is on https://gitlab.com/bstarynk/refpersys/ and has its
own web site on http://refpersys.org/ where more details are given.


## A research project

The Reflective Persistent System language is a **research project**,
taking many good ideas from
[Bismon](http://github.com/bstarynk/bismon), sharing a lot of goals
(*except* static source code analysis) with it but avoiding bad ideas
from it.

For Linux/x86-64 only. Don't even think of running that on non-Linux
systems, unless you provide patches for that. And we need a 64 bits
processor.

We have multi-threading in mind, but in some limited way. We think of
a pool of a few dozen Pthreads at most (but not of a thousand
Pthreads).

We absolutely want to avoid any
[GIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock)

Don't expect anything useful from RefPerSys before at least 2023. But
you could have fun sharing our ideas and experimenting yours.

We considered previously to use the garbage collector from [Ravenbrook
MPS](https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/). Since that project is
now obsolete, we gave up that idea.

**Don't expect RefPerSys to be a realistic project.** It is not (and
certainly not before 2025).

Some draft design ideas are written in the [RefPerSys design
draft](http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/refpersys-design.pdf) which is
very incomplete **work in progress**.


## funding and partners needed

If you happen to know about any research call for proposals or funding
opportunities in Europe (Euro zone) about this (e.g. related to
0[artificial general
intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)
goals) please mention them to [Basile
Starynkevitch](http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/) (France) by email to
`basile@starynkevitch.net`.

## persistent values

Like *Bismon*, RefPerSys is managing an evolving,
[persistable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)),
[heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management#HEAP) of
[dynamically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language)
typed,
[garbage-collected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)),
values, exactly like Bismon does (see *ยง2 Data and its persistence in
Bismon* of the [Bismon draft
report](http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/bismon-chariot-doc.pdf)...).
The
[semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science))
-but *not* the syntax- of values is on purpose close to those of
[Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)),
Python, Scheme, JavaScript, Go, or even Java, etc....  Most of these
RefPerSys values are
[immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object); for
example boxed strings, sets -with [dichotomic
search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomic_search) inside them-
or tuples of references to objects,
[closures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)),
etc ...- But some of these RefPerSys values are *mutable* objects, and
by *convention* every mutable value is called an *object*. Each
mutable object has its own lock, and any access or update of mutable
data inside objects is generally made under its lock. By exception,
some very few, and very often accessed, mutable fields inside objects
(e.g. their class) are
[atomic](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic) pointers, for
performance reasons. Objects have (exactly like in Bismon) attributes,
components, and some optional payload. An attribute is an association
between an object (called the key of that attribute) and some
RefPerSys arbitrary non-nil value (called the value of that
attribute), and each object has its mutable associative table of
attributes. A component is an arbitrary RefPerSys value, and each
object has some mutable vector of them.  The payload is any additional
mutable data (e.g. a string buffer, an mutable vector or hashtable of
values, some class metadata, etc...), owned by the object. So the data
model of a RefPerSys object is as flexible as the data model of
JavaScript. However, RefPerSys objects have a *mutable* class defining
their *behavior* (not their fields, which are represented as
attributes) so used for [dynamic message
dispatching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch).


## Worker threads and agenda of tasklets

*RefPerSys* will have a small *fixed* set of worker threads (perhaps a
dozen of them), each running some *agenda loop*; we would have some
central data structure (called *the agenda*, like in
[Bismon](http://github.com/bstarynk/bismon) (see ยง1.7 of the [Bismon
draft
report](http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/bismon-chariot-doc.pdf)...)
organizing runnable *tasklets* (e.g. a few FIFO queues of them). A
tasklet should conceptually run quickly (in a few milliseconds) and is
allowed to add or remove runnable tasklets (including itself) to the
agenda. Each worker thread is looping: fetching a runnable tasklet
from the agenda, then running that tasklet.

### the C-rewrite branch

It will contain more generated code, and we eventually want all the
generated code to be in C99, not C++11

## Contributing

Please ask, by email, the above RefPerSys team for C++ coding
conventions before starting non-trivial contributions to the C++
runtime of RefPerSys.  If you are contributing to its C++ runtime,
please **run `make clean` after any `git pull`**.

The GPLv3+ license of RefPerSys is unlikely to change before 2025 (and
probably even after).

## File conventions

The RefPerSys runtime is implemented in C++17, with hand-written C++
code in `*_rps.cc`, and has a single C++ header file `refpersys.hh`.
We don't claim to be C++ gurus. Most C++ experts could write more
genuine C++ code than we do and will find our C++ code pityful. We
just want our runtime to work, not to serve as an example of well
written C++17 code.

The prefered C++ compiler (in 2020Q1) for *RefPerSys* is
[GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/) version [8](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-8/) or
[9](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-9).

It could be worthwhile to sometimes compile *RefPerSys* with `clang++`
(see http://clang.llvm.org/ for more). In practice `make clean` then
`make RPS_BUILD_CXX=clang++`. The [Clang static
analyzer](https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/) could be useful, but
expect a lot of warnings, since C++ dont have [flexible array
members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_array_member) but we
need something similar.

*RefPerSys* may later also use generated C++ code in some `_*.cc`
file, some generated C code in some `_*.c` and generated C or C++
headers in some `_*.h` files. By convention, files starting with an
underscore are generated (but they may, or not, being git
versioned). Some generated C++ files which are `git add`-ed are under
`generated/` subdirectory.

We could need later some C++ generating program (maybe similar in
spirit to Bismon's
[BM_makeconst.cc](https://github.com/bstarynk/bismon/blob/master/BM_makeconst.cc). it
would then be named `rps_*` for the executable, and fits in a single
self-sufficient `rps_*.cc` C++ file. Perhaps we'll later have some
`rps_makeconst` executable to generate some C++, and its source in
some `rps_makeconst.cc`. So the convention is that any future C++
generating source code is in some `rps_*.cc` C++ file. In commit
`65a8f84aeffc9ba4e468` or newer the dumping facility is scanning
hand-written C++ source files to emit `generated/rps-constants.hh`


## Building and dependencies.

The [build automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation)
tool used here is [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) since
commit `6d56f50660c7cc41b9` (it was
[omake](https://github.com/ocaml-omake/omake) before).

You should have compiled and installed Ian Taylor's
[libbacktrace](https://github.com/ianlancetaylor/libbacktrace),
e.g. under `/usr/local/`. You may need to add `/usr/local/lib/` in
your `/etc/ld.so.conf` and run `ldconfig -v -a` after installation of
that `libbacktrace`.

The [JsonCPP](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/) and
[Qt5](http://qt.io/) C++ libraries are needed, and also a
[mail](https://linux.die.net/man/1/mail) command in your `$PATH`.

To install the dependencies on a recent [Debian](https://debian.org/) 10 *buster* or
[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) 20 or 21 system, you could run the following
steps

* `sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test` (for Ubuntu 20.04)
* `sudo apt install -y gcc-11 g++-11 clang-11 libc++-11-dev libc++abi-11-dev` (for Ubuntu 20.04)
* `sudo apt install libunistring-dev`
* `sudo apt install qt5-default libqt5x11extras5-dev libqt5xdg-dev`
* `sudo apt install libjsoncpp-dev`
* `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`
* `sudo apt install ccache g++ make build-essential remake gdb automake`
* `sudo apt install ttf-unifont ttf-mscorefonts-installer unifont msttcorefonts fonts-ubuntu fonts-tuffy fonts-spleen fonts-roboto fonts-recommended fonts-yanone-kaffeesatz fonts-play fonts-eurofurence fonts-ecolier-court fonts-dejavu fonts-croscore fonts-cegui fonts-inter fonts-inconsolata`
* `git clone https://github.com/ianlancetaylor/libbacktrace.git`
* `cd libbacktrace`
* `./configure`
* `make`
* `make install`

### Build instructions

You need a recent C++17 compiler such as `g++` (We use
[GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/) version [GCC
10](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/)) or [GCC
11](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-11/) or
[`clang++`](http://clang.llvm.org/) version [Clang
11](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html). Look into, and perhaps
improve, our `Makefile`. Build using `make -j 3` or more.
 
You also should do a  `make clean` after any `git pull`

You may want to edit your `$HOME/.refpersys.mk` file to contain
definitions of GNU `make` variables for your particular C and C++ compiler,
like e.g.

     # file ~/.refpersys.mk
     RPS_BUILD_CC= gcc-11
     RPS_BUILD_CXX= g++-11

You then build with `make -j4 refpersys && make all`

## Garbage collection

*RefPerSys* is a multi-threaded and garbage-collected system. We are
fully aware that multi-thread friendly and efficient garbage
collection is a very difficult topic.

The reader unaware of garbage collection terminology (*precise*
vs. *conservative* GC, *tracing garbage collection*, *copying* GC, GC
roots, GC locals, *mark and sweep* GC, *incremental* GC, *write
barrier*) is advised to read the [GC handbook](http://gchandbook.org/)
and is expected to have read *very carefully* the [Tracing Garbage
Collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection)
wikipage.

We have considered to use [Ravenbrook
MPS](https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/). Unfortunately for us,
that very good GC implementation seems unmaintained, and with almost a
hundred thousand lines of code is very difficult to grasp, understand,
and adopt. Finally, using MPS is not reasonable in our eyes.

We also did consider using [Boehm
GC](http://www.hboehm.info/gc/). That conservative GC is really simple
to use (basically, use `GC_MALLOC` instead of `malloc`, etc...) and is
[C++ friendly](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8019003/841108). However,
it is rather slow (even for allocations of GC-ed zones, and we would
have *many* of them) and might be quite unsuitable for programs having
*lots* of [circular
references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reference), and
reflexive programs have lots of them.


### Garbage collection ideas

So we probably are heading towards developing our own *precise* and
multi-thread friendly GC (hopefully "better" than Boehm, but worse
than MPS), with the following ideas:

* *local roots* in the local frame are *explicit*, like in Bismon
  (`LOCALFRAME_BM` macro of
  [bismon/cmacros_BM.h](https://github.com/bstarynk/bismon/blob/master/cmacros_BM.h))
  or Ocaml (see its [ยง20.5 *Living in harmony with the garbage
  collector*](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/intfc.html)
  and `CAMLlocal*` and `CAMLparam*` and `CAMLreturn*` macros). The
  local call frame is conventionally reified as the `_` local
  variable, so an [automatic
  variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_variable) GC-ed
  pointer `foo` is coded `_.foo` in our C++ runtime. A local frame in
  RefPerSys should be declared in C++ using `RPS_LOCALFRAME`.

* our garbage collector manages *memory zones* inside a set of
  `mmap`-ed *memory blocks* : either small blocks of a megaword that
  is 8 megabytes (i.e. `RPS_SMALL_BLOCK_SIZE`), or large blocks of 8
  megawords (i.e. `RPS_LARGE_BLOCK_SIZE`). Values are inside such
  memory zones. Mutable objects may contain -perhaps indirectly-
  pointers to *quasivalues* (notably in their payload), that is to
  garbage collected zones which are not first-class values. A typical
  example of quasivalue could be some bucket in some (fully
  RefPerSys-implemented) array hash table (appearing as the payload of
  some object), in which buckets would be some small and mutable
  dynamic arrays of entries with colliding hashes. Such buckets indeed
  garbage collected zones, but are not themselves values (since they
  are mutable, but not reified as objects).

* The GC allocation operations are explicitly given the pointer to the
  local frame (i.e. `&_`, named `RPS_CURFRAME`), which is linked to
  the previous call frame and so on. That pointer is passed to *every*
  routine needing the GC (i.e. allocating or mutating values); only
  functions which don't allocate or mutate (e.g. [accessor or getter
  functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutator_method)) can avoid
  getting that local frame pointer.
  
* The C++ runtime, and any code generated in RefPerSys, should
*explicitly* be in [A-normal
form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-normal_form). So coding `z =
f(g(x),y)` is forbidden in C++ (where `f` and `g` are C++ functions
using the GC). Instead, reserve a local slot such as `_.tmp1` in the
local frame, then code ``` _.tmp1 = g(RPS_CURFRAME, _.x); _.z =
f(RPS_CURFRAME, _.tmp1, _.y); ```
In less pedantic terms, we should do **only one call** (to GC-aware
functions) **or one allocation per statement**; and **every such
call** to some allocation primitive, or to a GC-aware function,
**should pass the `RPS_CURFRAME`** and **use `RPL_LOCALFRAME` in the
calling function**.
  
* A [*write barrier*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_barrier)
  should be called after object or quasivalue updates, and before any
  other allocation or update of some other object, value, or
  quasivalue. In practice, code
  `_.foo.rps_write_barrier(RPS_CURFRAME)` or more simply
  `_.foo.RPS_WRITE_BARRIER()`

* Every garbage-collection aware thread (a thread allocating GC-ed
  values, mutating GC-ed quasivalues or objects, running the GC
  forcibly) should call quite often, typically once per few
  milliseconds, the `Rps_GarbageCollector::maybe_garbcoll` routine. If
  this is not possible (e.g. before a potentially blocking `read` or
  `poll` system call), special precautions should be taken. Forgetting
  to call that `maybe_garbcoll` function often enough (typically every
  few milliseconds) could maybe crash the system.

* Consequently, as a rule of thumb, any routine which can directly *or
  indirectly* allocate GC-ed values or quasi-values, or directly *or
  indirectly* mutate GC-ed values or quasi-values, should take a
  calling callframe argument. We might need to consider: putting that
  specific `callframe` argument in some *global* register, using GCC
  `register` ... `asm` extension to [define global register
  variables](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Global-Register-Variables.html)
  and compile with the `-ffixed-`*reg* [code generation
  option](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Code-Gen-Options.html).
  By coding convention, that calling callframe argument should be
  preferably named `callingfra`, and should be the *first* argument of
  every function or methods (member functions in C++ classes)
  requiring the GC.

## useful and relevant libraries

We already need the following libraries:

* [libunistring](https://www.gnu.org/software/libunistring/) for [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) support, since [UTF-8 is everywhere](http://utf8everywhere.org/)
* [libbacktrace](https://github.com/ianlancetaylor/libbacktrace) for [backtraces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace)

We may want to use, either soon or within a few years, (usually after 2022) interesting C or C++ libraries such as:

* [libonion](https://www.coralbits.com/libonion/) or [Wt](https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt) should be very soon (even in 2019) useful for the web interface
* [libevent](http://libevent.org/) or [libev](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html) for some [event loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop) (quite soon).
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) purposes
* [Gudhi](http://gudhi.gforge.inria.fr/) for [topological data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis)
* [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) for [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) client 
* [GMPlib](https://gmplib.org/) for [Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic) or *Bignums*.
* [0mq](http://zeromq.org/) for distributed messaging, in relation with [distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing) and [message passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing) approaches.
* [JsonCPP](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp) could be useful for [JSON](http://json.org/).
* [POCO](https://pocoproject.org/) is a useful C++ generic framework library, and [Qt](http://qt.io/) might also be useful, even without its GUI aspect.

We should list other libraries interesting for us here, just in case (to avoid forgetting them).

## past contributors

Thanks to Niklas Rosencrantz (Sweden) for past minor contributions.

## HTTP service

We are adding HTTP service in *RefPerSys*. So
[libonion](https://github.com/davidmoreno/onion) is required.  For
many months, we just hope to use `http://localhost:9090/` in a recent
(e.g. Firefox 80) web browser.

We really need to be able to show a demo of RefPerSys on a laptop
*without* Internet connection. So all required resources should be
copied here, under `webroot/`. Be careful about copyright and
licensing issues.

### Web conventions.

The `webroot/` subdirectory holds resources useful for HTTP
requests. In particular the following subdirectories:

* `webroot/css/` for -hand-written- style sheets.

* `webroot/img/` for additional images. Prefer SVG or PNG formats.

* `webroot/js/` for JavaScript code.
